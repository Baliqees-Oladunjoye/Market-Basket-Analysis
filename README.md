# Market-Basket-Analysis

The era has come where the computer knows better about us than we do. Our device is so powerful that it knows what we are doing right now and what are we going to do in the future. The following application of AI is called a as Market Basket Analysis which is widely used in the Retail stores where the application predicts the closely associated items we are likely to buy along with the product we purhcased.

In this project, we use Groceries dataset, which has the dataset with 38765 rows of the purchase orders of people from the grocery stores. The dataset has only one csv.In these dataset above, I have analysed the dataset with visualizations and perform Association rule mining with the help of Apriori algorithm. I have never realized or questioned myself why these items are kept closely in the supermarket, thought that it was for customer's convenience but little did I know that it had a business impact.

Objectives of project are:
Getting and cleaning the data,
Understanding the data using EDA techniques,
Perform A-rule mining using Apriori algorithm,
Visualizing the results of association between items.
